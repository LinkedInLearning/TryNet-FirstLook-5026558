# Try .NET: FirstLook


This is the repository for the **LinkedIn Learning**  [Try .NET: First Look](#) course. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://linkedin.com/learning) and on the [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/) site.

## What is Try .NET?
Try .NET is a service created by Microsoft to help build interactive code samples. It provides an easy way to embed runnable .NET code snippets into a web page. For example,  you could embed the snippets into your company documentation website. Perfect for control vendors that have .NET tools. Or add live examples to your blog posts. Try.NET is also integrated into GitHub, this is helpful for open source projects that don’t have a dedicated documentation site.

## This course

This course looks at how to build a sample documentation site with `Markdown` files and `.NET console` applications.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `chapter#-video#`. As an example, the branch named `02-03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04-01`) and an end state (`04-01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The `master` branch holds the the initial state of the course and is not used for exercises during the course.
